// 2. difference between inline element and block element with example
// Block-level Elements
// Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretching left to right as far as possible).

// eg div, p, h1-h6, section

//----------------------------------------

//Inline Elements
// Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

// eg : span, a, strong, img

//<em>Emphasized text</em>
//<strong>Important text</strong>

//<span>Generic inline container</span>
